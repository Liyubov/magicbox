Ideas:

1. implementation of dashboard for the visualisation for giving the coordinates and number of schools around you based on your location.

2. implementation of language maps (mapping maps of languages to map of schools) http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/
for this project one would need just to request school coordinates and compare them to coordinates on the language atlas.
